</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> divine Poem, is designed by
the Holy Spirit, to exhibit the love of God our dear Saviour, to
his chosen people, with all the happy consequences of that
eternal affection.&nbsp; The whole book is full of Christ, as the
all in all of the Church, which he has purchased with his
blood&mdash;the union subsisting between the elect head and
chosen body.&nbsp; What Christ is to them, and they are to him,
is strikingly set forth by many well-known metaphors.&nbsp;
Perhaps there is nothing of greater importance in the Bible than
the Union subsisting between Jesus and his Church, the whole
Scriptures are full of it; all our salvation depends upon
it.&nbsp; The highest idea of Union is that glorious oneness in
the three Persons the adorable Trinity; that though they are <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>distinct in
Persons, Names and Offices, yet they are one in the divine
incomprehensible Essence.</p>
<p>The next idea of Union is the hypostatical Union of God in our
Nature: the Word made Flesh and dwelling among us.&nbsp; This is
the mystery of Godliness.&nbsp; The Union between the head and
members is the principal subject of this Song.&nbsp; That Christ
and his People are one, is an everlasting truth, the date of it
is eternal, it is indissolvable, it is mysterious, it is perfect,
and will endure to all eternity.&nbsp; Hence it is compared to
the Union that subsists between the foundation of a building and
its superstructure.&nbsp; Christ is the foundation stone, the
corner stone, the tried stone, and will be the top stone.</p>
<p>This Union is set forth by the metaphor of the head and the
body, while the love that united both is set forth in this song,
by the neck.&nbsp; The self-moving love of God will keep this
body and head in eternal Union.&nbsp; This is also represented by
the Vine and the Branches.&nbsp; <i>I am the Vine</i>, <i>ye are
the Branches</i>.&nbsp; All our fruit depends on Union with this
Vine&mdash;<i>In me is thy fruit found</i>.&nbsp; The scriptures
shew this doctrine by the Union that subsists between the Husband
and his Wife: this says the Apostle <i>is a great mystery</i>;
<i>but I speak concerning Christ and his Church</i>.</p>
<p>In consequence of this Union with Christ and <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>his People,
they become partakers of the same Spirit with him.&nbsp; He that
is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&nbsp; He took our nature, we
take his spirit, and like the men of Judah, we have two parts in
David.&nbsp; We are bone of bone, and flesh of his flesh; and the
Apostle tells us, <i>we are members of his body</i>, <i>of his
flesh</i>, <i>and of his bones</i>.&nbsp; Christ being united to
his Church, beholds it with admiration; highly commends her, and
to shew how dear she is to him, he laid down his life for her, in
the set time, to favor our souls.&nbsp; He subdues our enmity,
melts our hearts, reconciles our wills, draws our affections to
himself, and leads our faith to admire him, believe in him, rest
on him, and be satisfied with him.&nbsp; He loves us, we love
him; he chose us, we chuse him; he is delighted in us, we in him;
he sought us, we seek him; he commands us, we commend him; he
draws near to us, we draw near to him; he loves the company of
his people, they desire his; he invites them to his arms, his
house, his table, and to holy familiarity with him.&nbsp; His
people seeing his glory, beauty, suitableness, and love, intreat
him to visit them, to meet them, to abide with them, to be in
them, walk with them, talk with them, and indulge them with his
company.&nbsp; Thus the Union is mutual, and sweet communion is
the blessed effect of it.&nbsp; The Saviour must see of the
travail of his soul, in their complete conversion.&nbsp; He longs
for their coming home, and they long to get home to see him, who
is the brightness of the Father&rsquo;s <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>glory, and the express image of his
Person.&nbsp; Under this sweet influence of the spirit of love,
the Church breathes forth her earnest desires&mdash;<i>Make haste
my beloved</i>, <i>and be thou like to a Roe</i>, <i>or a young
Hart upon the mountains of spices</i>.</p>
<p>The first petition in this song is for clear manifestations of
his love.&nbsp; <i>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth</i>.&nbsp; And the last petition is the language of the
text, the earnest desire to see his face.&nbsp; This is the Alpha
and Omega of the Spirit&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>We shall first consider the object desired.&mdash;<i>My
beloved</i>.</p>
<p>Secondly, Her earnest request, <i>Make haste</i>.&nbsp; And
thirdly, The metaphor here made use of, <i>Be thou like a
Roe</i>, <i>or a young Hart upon the mountains of spices</i>.</p>
<p>First&mdash;The glorious object of the desire of every one
taught of God, emphatically stiled <i>My beloved</i>.&nbsp; This
title is given to Jesus, nineteen or twenty times in this book;
and no doubt is intended to point out the high esteem the church
has of her Saviour; the clearest, the sweetest evidence of a
person&rsquo;s interest in Christ, is love to the dear God-Man
Mediator.&nbsp; This principle is shed abroad in the heart; it is
always in the believer as <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>a principle; but it is not always shed
abroad in the feeling sense of it, we wish it was, as it is
calculated carry us above the love of sin, the love of self, the
love of the creature, and the love of the world.&nbsp; Christ as
the Christ of God, is the darling of heaven; the Father loves
him, and is well pleased with him.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s
principal aim in all his operations is to glorify him; the holy
angels admire and adore him, as their elect head; the spirits of
just men, made perfect, look on him with holy wonder, with
rapture, and joy; while every poor, tried, humble believer,
trusts in him, leans upon him, hopes in him, and sincerely
desires to love him above all things else.&nbsp; And if I know
any thing of experience, I must say in the behalf of the church,
it is our principal grief we think on him so little, trust him so
little, admire and adore him so little.&nbsp; This is a
lamentation, and must be so to the end of our days.&nbsp; But our
days of mourning on this subject will have an end&mdash;and</p>
<blockquote><p>Till then I would thy love proclaim,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With every feeling breath;<br />
And may the music of thy name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Refresh my soul in death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ is the beloved of his church for what is in himself, as
God-Man Mediator.&nbsp; Secondly, Christ is beloved of his church
for what he has done, and is now doing in heaven.&nbsp; If we
view him as God, possessing all divine perfections, and these <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>harmonizing and
engaged in our salvation, O! how glorious do they all
appear!&nbsp; Divine sovereignty chose us to salvation; loved
moved him to make this choice; wisdom drew the wonderous plan;
power executed it; goodness made provision for us; truth makes us
free; faithfulness is engaged to make good his promises; pity
redeemed us; compassion leads us to repentance; holiness makes
him all-glorious to us; righteousness justifies; justice forgives
us; and perfection renders us compleat in Christ.&nbsp; Thus all
his sublime attributes center in our salvation, and render Jesus
as equal with the Father, beloved to us, if we view him as Man
and Mediator.&nbsp; <i>There is</i>, says the Apostle to us,
<i>One God and one Mediator</i>, <i>the Man</i>, (i.e. <i>the God
Man</i>) <i>Christ Jesus</i>.&nbsp; In this human nature he is
the perfection of beauty; the Holy Spirit formed it, the Father
provided it, and the eternal Son of God appeared in it as our
Day&rsquo;s Man.&nbsp; It was filled with the Holy Ghost&mdash;it
was a sacred Temple, the residence of Deity.&nbsp; <i>The word
was made flesh</i>&mdash;<i>the word was God</i>.&nbsp; All
things were made by him.&nbsp; This human nature was holy,
harmless, undefiled, and separated from sinners; and such an High
Priest became us.&nbsp; And by virtue of the Union of the
Godhead; this dear God-Man is the Beloved of the whole
Church.</p>
<p>If we consider him in his Mediatorial capacity, sustaining his
glorious offices, as Prophet, Priest, <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and King.&nbsp; These offices no doubt
he refers to when he said I am the way, and the truth, and the
life; to these he was called.&nbsp; These he executes in the
church, and in the hearts of all believers.&nbsp; He enlightens
us as a Prophet, he intercedes as a Priest, and he reigns as a
King.&nbsp; He teaches the way to heaven as a Prophet, he opens
the way as a Priest, and he brings into the way as a King.&nbsp;
He preached glad tidings to the meek as a Prophet, he binds up
the broken-hearted as a Priest, and he opens the prison doors as
a king.&nbsp; These glorious offices he exercises in the souls of
his children, and viwing him faithful in his house, he is truly
lovely to his church.&nbsp; If we view him in his glorious
titles, it appears the Holy Ghost has ransacked all the endearing
ties of nature, and all the lovely instances of his creative
power, to set him forth&mdash;the affectionate Husband, the
constant Friend, the skilful Physician, the tender Father, the
able Counsellor, the sympathizing Mother and Nurse, the wise
Law-giver, the lovely Prince, the faithful Ambassador, and the
Advocate with the Father; the guide of his Children, and the
Captain of their salvation.&nbsp; He is represented as a Lamb, a
Hen, a Hind; surely</p>
<blockquote><p>All over glorious is our Lord;<br />
To be admir&rsquo;d, and yet ador&rsquo;d:<br />
His worth if all the nations knew,<br />
Sure the whole earth would love him too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The operations of his hands as the adorable Creator, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>sets him
forth in his goodness, greatness, and glory&mdash;the earth is
full of his praise&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He shines in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,<br
/>
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every drop of dew, every shower of rain, every blade of grass,
every rolling peal of thunder, and every flash of lightning,
loudly proclaims the eternal power and Godhead of him who lived,
and loved, and died for us.&nbsp; The word of the eternal truth,
the Scriptures, are an exhibition of his loving heart.&nbsp; Its
histories, types, shadows, and parables&mdash;all the illustrious
characters that appeared before him were only as dim stars, to
usher in the glorious luminary, the Light of Life.&nbsp; Every
promise, invitation, and declaration, all, all! proclaim the
Beloved.&nbsp; O for hearts to love him more, and serve him
without reserve, and to long to be with him, that we may behold
his glory for ever.</p>
<p>But, Secondly, The Request made for his speedy appearance,
<i>Make hast my beloved</i>; <i>be thou like a Roe</i>, <i>or
young Hart upon the mountains of spices</i>.&nbsp; This may
include in it the earnest wish of the Old Testament saints for
the Incarnation of Jesus; it had been long foretold, and it was
expected by all the saints, though nearly four thousand years
rolled away before their desires were accomplished.&nbsp; The
dear Messiah made his appearance at last, to put away sin, to
honor the <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>Law, to satisfy Justice, to glorify the attributes of
Deity, bar the mouth of the bottomless Pit, and open the gates of
the celestial City.&nbsp; How beautiful the language of the
Church, (<span class="smcap">Te Deum</span>) <i>When thou tookest
upon thee to deliver man thou didst not abhor the Virgin&rsquo;s
womb</i>.&nbsp; <i>When thou hadst overcome the sharpness of
death</i>, <i>thou dist open the kingdom of heaven to all
Believers</i>.&nbsp; This was the subject matter of the faith of
Old Testament saints.&nbsp; This important God-glorifying event,
they anticipated, and though millions of the elect died without
the sight, they all died in faith, embracing the promises, and
Jesus in them.</p>
<p>This Chapter opens and closes with their ardent wish, <i>O
that thou wert as my brother</i>, <i>that sucked the breasts of
my mother</i>!&nbsp; <i>Make haste my Beloved</i>.&nbsp; When
Believers, on any occasion, pray thus, we are not to suppose they
wish for the blessing before the time, though in fact, as the
Saviour said on another occasion, Your time is always
ready.&nbsp; But there is a time for every purpose, a set time,
and Christ came in the fulness of time, nor will he delay one
blessing laid up for his people beyond the time.&nbsp; Faith is
always willing to wait God&rsquo;s time, but unbelief is always
in a hurry, <i>He that hasteth with his feet sinneth&mdash;he
that believeth shall not make haste</i>.</p>
<p>Secondly, The Request may be considered as <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>made by the
Church of God in the depths of trouble, when storms of fierce
persecution has involved her, or awful errors abounding and
carrying away many professors; and such has been the case of the
Church frequently: this may be seen clearly in the state of the
Gospel Church, as stated in the 12th of the Revelations.&nbsp;
Blessed be God, in the worst times, there have been a few praying
souls, who have been concerned for the glory of the Redeemer, the
cause of truth, and the welfare of Zion.&nbsp; Such have united
their petitions for the delivery of Zion, and obtained an answer,
as Moses did, <i>I have seen the afflictions of my people</i>,
<i>and I am come down to deliver them</i>.&nbsp; And as the
Psalmist also obtained the blessed answer, <i>For the oppression
of the poor</i>, <i>and the sighing of the needy</i>, <i>now will
I arise</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, This Request for the coming of Jesus, may be
considered as the language of a soul in straits and
difficulties.&nbsp; Hence, some have exclaimed, <i>Make haste to
help me</i>, <i>O my God</i>, <i>make no long tarrying</i>.&nbsp;
The burden of guilt, the power of unbelief, the temptation of the
enemy, the frowns of the world, the loss of all that is near and
dear, the fears of being lost at last, that what has been
experienced is but the attainments of an hypocrite; and at the
same time, amidst all these things there is to be found the
<i>one good thing toward the Lord God of Israel</i>, an inward
breathing after Jesus, a <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>thirsting for the living God&mdash;a
desire to be delivered in God&rsquo;s way, either by an open
manifestation of Christ to the soul, or a strengthening,
faith-encouraging hope, applying a promise or melting the soul in
the flames of eternal love.&nbsp; A kind hint, a love-token, or a
sweet view of Jesus afresh.&mdash;Hence the argument of the
church of old, <i>Wilt thou not revive us again</i>, <i>that we
may rejoice in thee</i>?&nbsp; <i>Make haste therefore</i>, <i>my
beloved</i>.</p>
<p>Fourthly, This Request may be considered as the church&rsquo;s
desire for the manifestative presence of Christ; nothing,
perhaps, can exceed this New Covenant promise, <i>I will dwell
with them</i>.&mdash;Surely with rapture and surprise we must
ask, <i>And will God in very deed dwell with men on the
earth</i>?&nbsp; Stupendous condescension! infinite grace and
love!</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Stand in amaze ye
rolling skies,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presence of Jesus is life and peace&mdash;it softens the
hard cares of life, sanctifies humble poverty; makes obedience
easy; trials sweet; ordinances precious; and eternity
desirable.&nbsp; The presence of Jesus endears the blessings of
providence; adds a glory to creation, and causes the earth to be
filled with his praise.&nbsp; This gives a relish to the bounties
of nature; adds a double beauty to flowers, and a double
sweetness to fruits.</p>
<p>This Request may be considered as the language <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of the whole
Church, longing for the second coming of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; It
is clearly revealed that the Lord will appear again the second
time, without spot and sin, to salvation; the brightest display
of history, and the complete Deliverer of his people.&nbsp; It is
necessary he should appear again&mdash;the consummation of the
Marriage Union is an event our dear Lord must accomplish, when he
will leave the third heavens, and descend into the air with his
heavenly retinue, to meet his Bride complete, body and soul, upon
her resurrection from the dead.&nbsp; O what a joyful meeting of
the heavenly Bridegroom and the spiritual Bride, of the glorious
company of saints and angels, of the body and souls of
God&rsquo;s children, to sin no more, to sorrow no more, but to
be like Jesus, see his face, enjoy his smiles, and so be for ever
with the Lord.&nbsp; The thought is animating&mdash;Come, Lord
Jesus, come quickly!&nbsp; <i>Make haste</i>, <i>my
beloved</i>&mdash;the event will be awful, but glorious, the
procession such as never has taken place in the upper or lower
worlds.&nbsp; Perhaps some things are said about it, in allusion
to earthly processions when a judge enters a town.&nbsp; O when
the stars fall, when the sun hides his head, when the moon is
confounded, when the world is in a blaze, then, then! O gracious
Saviour, own us in that day for thine; and he surely will, O
believers, as you have been enabled to own him in the midst of a
crooked and perverse generation; as sure as you are born again of
the spirit, love him in soul, cleave to him in faith <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and hope,
depend on him for life and salvation, and love all his gracious
appearances.&nbsp; The crown is laid up for them who love his
appearance.&mdash;This leads us to notice the metaphor here made
use of, <i>a Roe or a young Hart upon the mountains of
spices</i>.&nbsp; This is a phrase frequently used in this Song;
and sometimes Christ is compared to these lovely creatures, no
doubt, for their loving natures, excellent and choice, for the
antipathy between them and serpents&mdash;for their thirst, after
the conflict they usually have with Serpents: they are also
remarkable for longivity, but in this text are mentioned to shew
their remarkable swiftness of foot: their speediness is used to
set forth the swiftness of Christ to the soul, over mountains of
sorrow, hills of grief, over all the difficulties that are in the
way.&nbsp; The request, then, is simply thus, Make haste my
beloved, and fly swift to me, as a Roe or Hart upon mountains,
where they delight to run and skip: so his gracious presence is
desired on the mountains of Zion, the congregations of the
saints, and the hearth and families of believers.&nbsp; The
celebrated Dr. <i>Gill</i> thinks these mountains refer to the
glory beyond the grave: the height and sublimity of this happy
state; it is above, reserved in heaven&mdash;a hope, a crown laid
up, the prize of the high calling&mdash;it is a permanency, an
everlasting joy&mdash;pleasures for evermore!</p>
<blockquote><p>O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!<br />
Full without measure, lasting without bounds!<br />
A perpetuity of bliss is bliss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>I trust
our dear friend and Brother is now in the enjoyment of this
unspeakable felicity; to this all the people of God were
predestinated by the Father&mdash;for this they were redeemed by
Jesus&mdash;for this they are called by the Holy Spirit, made
partakers of a divine nature and preserved unto this kingdom and
glory.&nbsp; This inheritance is sure to all the seed; but there
must be a preparation for it, a calling out of the world, a good
hope through grace; the pardon of sin, and a receiving the
righteousness of God our Saviour.&nbsp; There must be a knowledge
of Jesus, union to him and communion with him; this is our
meetness for glory; and however uncandid it may be deemed, I am
bold to affirm, that no man can behold the face of God with joy,
without those blessings in time.&nbsp; Hear this</p>
<blockquote><p>Ye opposers, transgressors of every degree,<br />
And formal professors, the worst of the three.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it respects our departed Friend, it appears he had lived in
nature&rsquo;s darkness, sin, and misery, like the rest of
mankind, till about a year ago, when it pleased the Lord to lead
him to hear the Gospel as preached by unworthy me.&nbsp; I
believe the passage I had occasion at that time to discourse on
was, <i>Look not upon me because I am black</i>, <i>because the
sun hath looked on me</i>.&nbsp; I rather suppose his convictions
began about this time; the word laid hold of his heart; he saw
himself a lost sinner, justly condemned by the Law, which he soon
found <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>to
be spiritual, that it cursed him for a sinful thought as well as
sinful works.&nbsp; The fears of death, the guilt of sin, the
suggestions of Satan, and the dread of judgment and eternity,
were all felt by him.&mdash;He found himself shut up in unbelief,
and neither might or power of his own could extricate
him.&mdash;He was at the same time sadly tried in circumstances,
so that the hand of God seemed to go out against him in every
direction.&nbsp; But that most blessed Spirit of all grace, who
had taken possession of his soul, and given him light to see and
life to feel himself a sinner, also begot in him a living hope,
that he should be delivered.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit convinced him
of unbelief, and at the same time operated on his mind as a
spirit of faith.&nbsp; He convinced him of his carnal enmity, yet
operated as a spirit of love.</p>
<p>Thus the blessed Spirit generally deals with his dear
people.&nbsp; Our Brother, amidst all he felt, attended
constantly on the word&mdash;and he that waiteth on his Master
shall be honored, and so he found it.</p>
<p>The glorious Gospel exhibits the eternal love of the Father,
the freeness of divine grace, and the pardon of the vilest,
through the blood of the Lamb.&nbsp; These immortal truths,
accompanied by the power of the Spirit, begot in his mind a
pleasing hope of salvation.&nbsp; Love operated in his heart as
faith was <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>led to eye the Saviour, and by waiting on the Lord his
faith grew strong in the doctrines of the Cross, so that he
gradually experienced the joys of salvation, which did not leave
him, but for a season, till his dissolution.</p>
<p>Through a variety of trials and wants his health began rapidly
to decline, and soon baffled the use of medicine: but as the body
was thus gravitating to its own center, the dust, his soul was
happy in a good hope, through grace, the love of God, and the
precious Person of Jesus.</p>
<p>When confined to his bed I had occasion to visit him often,
and generally found him happy.&nbsp; I must confess I staggered a
little at his felicity, but I knew the Holy Spirit was a
Sovereign, and had a right to do as he pleased.&nbsp; But I
apprized our Friend, that I doubted whether he would go quite so
easy to heaven, without a cloud, without an assault, without a
temptation: not but he was deeply afflicted in his body; and it
is the mercy of God&rsquo;s elect to experience this grand truth,
<i>He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the East
wind</i>.&mdash;In a few days time my prediction of his troubles
came to pass.&nbsp; He was tried and tempted indeed.&nbsp; His
body getting worse, Satan took occasion from some trying
circumstances which occurred, to distress his mind, which
absolutely deprived him of his rationality for some few days and
nights, with very <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>few intervals of sanity.&nbsp; But while in this
afflicted state Prayer was made for him constantly among us, and
by the kindness of the Church, especially the younger brethren,
who were assiduous in their attention to him, we had the
happiness of seeing him restored, and once more composed, and
happy in Jesus.&nbsp; But the time drew near that he must die:
the Lord dealt very graciously with him in that solemn period,
for which we have much cause to be thankful.</p>
<p>On the Lord&rsquo;s-day morning of his death, he was visited
by many godly characters.&nbsp; He looked around on them all, and
thanked them for their kind attention to him and his
family.&nbsp; When it was intimated they should soon see each
other in glory, he smiled, and said, <i>I shall be so taken up
with Jesus</i>, <i>I shall not be able to think much of any one
else</i>.&nbsp; He now appeared to be dying upward, but spoke of
it without dismay; being wearied he desired to be once more
turned in his bed.&nbsp; He dosed a little while; when well
awoke, he exclaimed, <i>Christ is all in all</i>!&nbsp; He
paused; then earnestly said <i>Blessed Jesus</i>, <i>hast thou
not promised I shall be with thee</i>? <i>and thou canst not be
worse than thy word</i>.&nbsp; He paused again, then cried out,
<i>He has done all things well</i>.&nbsp; Then he said again,
<i>Thou dear Redeemer</i>, <i>dying Lamb</i>, <i>I love to hear
of thee</i>.&nbsp; At three in the afternoon he seemed to be
sinking in the arms of death, and solemnly said to a friend, <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span><i>I am
getting nearer</i>.&mdash;Then he said soon after, <i>I am very
near</i>&mdash;<i>I am quite close</i>&mdash;(to his eternal home
he meant).&nbsp; At about the close of the day after, having laid
some time quiet, he exclaimed, <i>Come Lord</i>, <i>come Lord
Jesus</i>, <i>come quickly</i>!&nbsp; <i>Come Lord</i>,
<i>come</i>!&mdash;<i>He is come</i>, <i>he is come</i>!&nbsp;
<i>I come</i>, <i>I come</i>!&nbsp; His voice gradually fell, but
as long as his lips could move, his friends could hear him say,
<i>Come</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>come</i>!&nbsp; With these words he
dropt asleep in the arms of our blessed Lord&mdash;to whom be
glory.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
