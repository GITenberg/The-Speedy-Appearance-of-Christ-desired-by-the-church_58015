    _Make haste_, _my Beloved_, _and be thou like to a Roe_, _or a young_
                     _Hart upon the Mountains of Spices_.

THIS divine Poem, is designed by the Holy Spirit, to exhibit the love of
God our dear Saviour, to his chosen people, with all the happy
consequences of that eternal affection.  The whole book is full of
Christ, as the all in all of the Church, which he has purchased with his
blood—the union subsisting between the elect head and chosen body.  What
Christ is to them, and they are to him, is strikingly set forth by many
well-known metaphors.  Perhaps there is nothing of greater importance in
the Bible than the Union subsisting between Jesus and his Church, the
whole Scriptures are full of it; all our salvation depends upon it.  The
highest idea of Union is that glorious oneness in the three Persons the
adorable Trinity; that though they are distinct in Persons, Names and
Offices, yet they are one in the divine incomprehensible Essence.

The next idea of Union is the hypostatical Union of God in our Nature:
the Word made Flesh and dwelling among us.  This is the mystery of
Godliness.  The Union between the head and members is the principal
subject of this Song.  That Christ and his People are one, is an
everlasting truth, the date of it is eternal, it is indissolvable, it is
mysterious, it is perfect, and will endure to all eternity.  Hence it is
compared to the Union that subsists between the foundation of a building
and its superstructure.  Christ is the foundation stone, the corner
stone, the tried stone, and will be the top stone.

This Union is set forth by the metaphor of the head and the body, while
the love that united both is set forth in this song, by the neck.  The
self-moving love of God will keep this body and head in eternal Union.
This is also represented by the Vine and the Branches.  _I am the Vine_,
_ye are the Branches_.  All our fruit depends on Union with this Vine—_In
me is thy fruit found_.  The scriptures shew this doctrine by the Union
that subsists between the Husband and his Wife: this says the Apostle _is
a great mystery_; _but I speak concerning Christ and his Church_.

In consequence of this Union with Christ and his People, they become
partakers of the same Spirit with him.  He that is joined to the Lord is
one spirit.  He took our nature, we take his spirit, and like the men of
Judah, we have two parts in David.  We are bone of bone, and flesh of his
flesh; and the Apostle tells us, _we are members of his body_, _of his
flesh_, _and of his bones_.  Christ being united to his Church, beholds
it with admiration; highly commends her, and to shew how dear she is to
him, he laid down his life for her, in the set time, to favor our souls.
He subdues our enmity, melts our hearts, reconciles our wills, draws our
affections to himself, and leads our faith to admire him, believe in him,
rest on him, and be satisfied with him.  He loves us, we love him; he
chose us, we chuse him; he is delighted in us, we in him; he sought us,
we seek him; he commands us, we commend him; he draws near to us, we draw
near to him; he loves the company of his people, they desire his; he
invites them to his arms, his house, his table, and to holy familiarity
with him.  His people seeing his glory, beauty, suitableness, and love,
intreat him to visit them, to meet them, to abide with them, to be in
them, walk with them, talk with them, and indulge them with his company.
Thus the Union is mutual, and sweet communion is the blessed effect of
it.  The Saviour must see of the travail of his soul, in their complete
conversion.  He longs for their coming home, and they long to get home to
see him, who is the brightness of the Father’s glory, and the express
image of his Person.  Under this sweet influence of the spirit of love,
the Church breathes forth her earnest desires—_Make haste my beloved_,
_and be thou like to a Roe_, _or a young Hart upon the mountains of
spices_.

The first petition in this song is for clear manifestations of his love.
_Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth_.  And the last petition is
the language of the text, the earnest desire to see his face.  This is
the Alpha and Omega of the Spirit’s teaching.

We shall first consider the object desired.—_My beloved_.

Secondly, Her earnest request, _Make haste_.  And thirdly, The metaphor
here made use of, _Be thou like a Roe_, _or a young Hart upon the
mountains of spices_.

First—The glorious object of the desire of every one taught of God,
emphatically stiled _My beloved_.  This title is given to Jesus, nineteen
or twenty times in this book; and no doubt is intended to point out the
high esteem the church has of her Saviour; the clearest, the sweetest
evidence of a person’s interest in Christ, is love to the dear God-Man
Mediator.  This principle is shed abroad in the heart; it is always in
the believer as a principle; but it is not always shed abroad in the
feeling sense of it, we wish it was, as it is calculated carry us above
the love of sin, the love of self, the love of the creature, and the love
of the world.  Christ as the Christ of God, is the darling of heaven; the
Father loves him, and is well pleased with him.  The Holy Spirit’s
principal aim in all his operations is to glorify him; the holy angels
admire and adore him, as their elect head; the spirits of just men, made
perfect, look on him with holy wonder, with rapture, and joy; while every
poor, tried, humble believer, trusts in him, leans upon him, hopes in
him, and sincerely desires to love him above all things else.  And if I
know any thing of experience, I must say in the behalf of the church, it
is our principal grief we think on him so little, trust him so little,
admire and adore him so little.  This is a lamentation, and must be so to
the end of our days.  But our days of mourning on this subject will have
an end—and

    Till then I would thy love proclaim,
       With every feeling breath;
    And may the music of thy name,
       Refresh my soul in death.

Christ is the beloved of his church for what is in himself, as God-Man
Mediator.  Secondly, Christ is beloved of his church for what he has
done, and is now doing in heaven.  If we view him as God, possessing all
divine perfections, and these harmonizing and engaged in our salvation,
O! how glorious do they all appear!  Divine sovereignty chose us to
salvation; loved moved him to make this choice; wisdom drew the wonderous
plan; power executed it; goodness made provision for us; truth makes us
free; faithfulness is engaged to make good his promises; pity redeemed
us; compassion leads us to repentance; holiness makes him all-glorious to
us; righteousness justifies; justice forgives us; and perfection renders
us compleat in Christ.  Thus all his sublime attributes center in our
salvation, and render Jesus as equal with the Father, beloved to us, if
we view him as Man and Mediator.  _There is_, says the Apostle to us,
_One God and one Mediator_, _the Man_, (i.e. _the God Man_) _Christ
Jesus_.  In this human nature he is the perfection of beauty; the Holy
Spirit formed it, the Father provided it, and the eternal Son of God
appeared in it as our Day’s Man.  It was filled with the Holy Ghost—it
was a sacred Temple, the residence of Deity.  _The word was made
flesh_—_the word was God_.  All things were made by him.  This human
nature was holy, harmless, undefiled, and separated from sinners; and
such an High Priest became us.  And by virtue of the Union of the
Godhead; this dear God-Man is the Beloved of the whole Church.

If we consider him in his Mediatorial capacity, sustaining his glorious
offices, as Prophet, Priest, and King.  These offices no doubt he refers
to when he said I am the way, and the truth, and the life; to these he
was called.  These he executes in the church, and in the hearts of all
believers.  He enlightens us as a Prophet, he intercedes as a Priest, and
he reigns as a King.  He teaches the way to heaven as a Prophet, he opens
the way as a Priest, and he brings into the way as a King.  He preached
glad tidings to the meek as a Prophet, he binds up the broken-hearted as
a Priest, and he opens the prison doors as a king.  These glorious
offices he exercises in the souls of his children, and viwing him
faithful in his house, he is truly lovely to his church.  If we view him
in his glorious titles, it appears the Holy Ghost has ransacked all the
endearing ties of nature, and all the lovely instances of his creative
power, to set him forth—the affectionate Husband, the constant Friend,
the skilful Physician, the tender Father, the able Counsellor, the
sympathizing Mother and Nurse, the wise Law-giver, the lovely Prince, the
faithful Ambassador, and the Advocate with the Father; the guide of his
Children, and the Captain of their salvation.  He is represented as a
Lamb, a Hen, a Hind; surely

    All over glorious is our Lord;
    To be admir’d, and yet ador’d:
    His worth if all the nations knew,
    Sure the whole earth would love him too.

The operations of his hands as the adorable Creator, sets him forth in
his goodness, greatness, and glory—the earth is full of his praise—

    He shines in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
    Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees.

Every drop of dew, every shower of rain, every blade of grass, every
rolling peal of thunder, and every flash of lightning, loudly proclaims
the eternal power and Godhead of him who lived, and loved, and died for
us.  The word of the eternal truth, the Scriptures, are an exhibition of
his loving heart.  Its histories, types, shadows, and parables—all the
illustrious characters that appeared before him were only as dim stars,
to usher in the glorious luminary, the Light of Life.  Every promise,
invitation, and declaration, all, all! proclaim the Beloved.  O for
hearts to love him more, and serve him without reserve, and to long to be
with him, that we may behold his glory for ever.

But, Secondly, The Request made for his speedy appearance, _Make hast my
beloved_; _be thou like a Roe_, _or young Hart upon the mountains of
spices_.  This may include in it the earnest wish of the Old Testament
saints for the Incarnation of Jesus; it had been long foretold, and it
was expected by all the saints, though nearly four thousand years rolled
away before their desires were accomplished.  The dear Messiah made his
appearance at last, to put away sin, to honor the Law, to satisfy
Justice, to glorify the attributes of Deity, bar the mouth of the
bottomless Pit, and open the gates of the celestial City.  How beautiful
the language of the Church, (TE DEUM) _When thou tookest upon thee to
deliver man thou didst not abhor the Virgin’s womb_.  _When thou hadst
overcome the sharpness of death_, _thou dist open the kingdom of heaven
to all Believers_.  This was the subject matter of the faith of Old
Testament saints.  This important God-glorifying event, they anticipated,
and though millions of the elect died without the sight, they all died in
faith, embracing the promises, and Jesus in them.

This Chapter opens and closes with their ardent wish, _O that thou wert
as my brother_, _that sucked the breasts of my mother_!  _Make haste my
Beloved_.  When Believers, on any occasion, pray thus, we are not to
suppose they wish for the blessing before the time, though in fact, as
the Saviour said on another occasion, Your time is always ready.  But
there is a time for every purpose, a set time, and Christ came in the
fulness of time, nor will he delay one blessing laid up for his people
beyond the time.  Faith is always willing to wait God’s time, but
unbelief is always in a hurry, _He that hasteth with his feet sinneth—he
that believeth shall not make haste_.

Secondly, The Request may be considered as made by the Church of God in
the depths of trouble, when storms of fierce persecution has involved
her, or awful errors abounding and carrying away many professors; and
such has been the case of the Church frequently: this may be seen clearly
in the state of the Gospel Church, as stated in the 12th of the
Revelations.  Blessed be God, in the worst times, there have been a few
praying souls, who have been concerned for the glory of the Redeemer, the
cause of truth, and the welfare of Zion.  Such have united their
petitions for the delivery of Zion, and obtained an answer, as Moses did,
_I have seen the afflictions of my people_, _and I am come down to
deliver them_.  And as the Psalmist also obtained the blessed answer,
_For the oppression of the poor_, _and the sighing of the needy_, _now
will I arise_, _saith the Lord_.

Thirdly, This Request for the coming of Jesus, may be considered as the
language of a soul in straits and difficulties.  Hence, some have
exclaimed, _Make haste to help me_, _O my God_, _make no long tarrying_.
The burden of guilt, the power of unbelief, the temptation of the enemy,
the frowns of the world, the loss of all that is near and dear, the fears
of being lost at last, that what has been experienced is but the
attainments of an hypocrite; and at the same time, amidst all these
things there is to be found the _one good thing toward the Lord God of
Israel_, an inward breathing after Jesus, a thirsting for the living
God—a desire to be delivered in God’s way, either by an open
manifestation of Christ to the soul, or a strengthening,
faith-encouraging hope, applying a promise or melting the soul in the
flames of eternal love.  A kind hint, a love-token, or a sweet view of
Jesus afresh.—Hence the argument of the church of old, _Wilt thou not
revive us again_, _that we may rejoice in thee_?  _Make haste therefore_,
_my beloved_.

Fourthly, This Request may be considered as the church’s desire for the
manifestative presence of Christ; nothing, perhaps, can exceed this New
Covenant promise, _I will dwell with them_.—Surely with rapture and
surprise we must ask, _And will God in very deed dwell with men on the
earth_?  Stupendous condescension! infinite grace and love!

                       Stand in amaze ye rolling skies,

The presence of Jesus is life and peace—it softens the hard cares of
life, sanctifies humble poverty; makes obedience easy; trials sweet;
ordinances precious; and eternity desirable.  The presence of Jesus
endears the blessings of providence; adds a glory to creation, and causes
the earth to be filled with his praise.  This gives a relish to the
bounties of nature; adds a double beauty to flowers, and a double
sweetness to fruits.

This Request may be considered as the language of the whole Church,
longing for the second coming of Jesus Christ.  It is clearly revealed
that the Lord will appear again the second time, without spot and sin, to
salvation; the brightest display of history, and the complete Deliverer
of his people.  It is necessary he should appear again—the consummation
of the Marriage Union is an event our dear Lord must accomplish, when he
will leave the third heavens, and descend into the air with his heavenly
retinue, to meet his Bride complete, body and soul, upon her resurrection
from the dead.  O what a joyful meeting of the heavenly Bridegroom and
the spiritual Bride, of the glorious company of saints and angels, of the
body and souls of God’s children, to sin no more, to sorrow no more, but
to be like Jesus, see his face, enjoy his smiles, and so be for ever with
the Lord.  The thought is animating—Come, Lord Jesus, come quickly!
_Make haste_, _my beloved_—the event will be awful, but glorious, the
procession such as never has taken place in the upper or lower worlds.
Perhaps some things are said about it, in allusion to earthly processions
when a judge enters a town.  O when the stars fall, when the sun hides
his head, when the moon is confounded, when the world is in a blaze,
then, then! O gracious Saviour, own us in that day for thine; and he
surely will, O believers, as you have been enabled to own him in the
midst of a crooked and perverse generation; as sure as you are born again
of the spirit, love him in soul, cleave to him in faith and hope, depend
on him for life and salvation, and love all his gracious appearances.
The crown is laid up for them who love his appearance.—This leads us to
notice the metaphor here made use of, _a Roe or a young Hart upon the
mountains of spices_.  This is a phrase frequently used in this Song; and
sometimes Christ is compared to these lovely creatures, no doubt, for
their loving natures, excellent and choice, for the antipathy between
them and serpents—for their thirst, after the conflict they usually have
with Serpents: they are also remarkable for longivity, but in this text
are mentioned to shew their remarkable swiftness of foot: their
speediness is used to set forth the swiftness of Christ to the soul, over
mountains of sorrow, hills of grief, over all the difficulties that are
in the way.  The request, then, is simply thus, Make haste my beloved,
and fly swift to me, as a Roe or Hart upon mountains, where they delight
to run and skip: so his gracious presence is desired on the mountains of
Zion, the congregations of the saints, and the hearth and families of
believers.  The celebrated Dr. _Gill_ thinks these mountains refer to the
glory beyond the grave: the height and sublimity of this happy state; it
is above, reserved in heaven—a hope, a crown laid up, the prize of the
high calling—it is a permanency, an everlasting joy—pleasures for
evermore!

    O ye blest scenes of permanent delight!
    Full without measure, lasting without bounds!
    A perpetuity of bliss is bliss.

I trust our dear friend and Brother is now in the enjoyment of this
unspeakable felicity; to this all the people of God were predestinated by
the Father—for this they were redeemed by Jesus—for this they are called
by the Holy Spirit, made partakers of a divine nature and preserved unto
this kingdom and glory.  This inheritance is sure to all the seed; but
there must be a preparation for it, a calling out of the world, a good
hope through grace; the pardon of sin, and a receiving the righteousness
of God our Saviour.  There must be a knowledge of Jesus, union to him and
communion with him; this is our meetness for glory; and however uncandid
it may be deemed, I am bold to affirm, that no man can behold the face of
God with joy, without those blessings in time.  Hear this

    Ye opposers, transgressors of every degree,
    And formal professors, the worst of the three.

As it respects our departed Friend, it appears he had lived in nature’s
darkness, sin, and misery, like the rest of mankind, till about a year
ago, when it pleased the Lord to lead him to hear the Gospel as preached
by unworthy me.  I believe the passage I had occasion at that time to
discourse on was, _Look not upon me because I am black_, _because the sun
hath looked on me_.  I rather suppose his convictions began about this
time; the word laid hold of his heart; he saw himself a lost sinner,
justly condemned by the Law, which he soon found to be spiritual, that it
cursed him for a sinful thought as well as sinful works.  The fears of
death, the guilt of sin, the suggestions of Satan, and the dread of
judgment and eternity, were all felt by him.—He found himself shut up in
unbelief, and neither might or power of his own could extricate him.—He
was at the same time sadly tried in circumstances, so that the hand of
God seemed to go out against him in every direction.  But that most
blessed Spirit of all grace, who had taken possession of his soul, and
given him light to see and life to feel himself a sinner, also begot in
him a living hope, that he should be delivered.  The Holy Spirit
convinced him of unbelief, and at the same time operated on his mind as a
spirit of faith.  He convinced him of his carnal enmity, yet operated as
a spirit of love.

Thus the blessed Spirit generally deals with his dear people.  Our
Brother, amidst all he felt, attended constantly on the word—and he that
waiteth on his Master shall be honored, and so he found it.

The glorious Gospel exhibits the eternal love of the Father, the freeness
of divine grace, and the pardon of the vilest, through the blood of the
Lamb.  These immortal truths, accompanied by the power of the Spirit,
begot in his mind a pleasing hope of salvation.  Love operated in his
heart as faith was led to eye the Saviour, and by waiting on the Lord his
faith grew strong in the doctrines of the Cross, so that he gradually
experienced the joys of salvation, which did not leave him, but for a
season, till his dissolution.

Through a variety of trials and wants his health began rapidly to
decline, and soon baffled the use of medicine: but as the body was thus
gravitating to its own center, the dust, his soul was happy in a good
hope, through grace, the love of God, and the precious Person of Jesus.

When confined to his bed I had occasion to visit him often, and generally
found him happy.  I must confess I staggered a little at his felicity,
but I knew the Holy Spirit was a Sovereign, and had a right to do as he
pleased.  But I apprized our Friend, that I doubted whether he would go
quite so easy to heaven, without a cloud, without an assault, without a
temptation: not but he was deeply afflicted in his body; and it is the
mercy of God’s elect to experience this grand truth, _He stayeth his
rough wind in the day of the East wind_.—In a few days time my prediction
of his troubles came to pass.  He was tried and tempted indeed.  His body
getting worse, Satan took occasion from some trying circumstances which
occurred, to distress his mind, which absolutely deprived him of his
rationality for some few days and nights, with very few intervals of
sanity.  But while in this afflicted state Prayer was made for him
constantly among us, and by the kindness of the Church, especially the
younger brethren, who were assiduous in their attention to him, we had
the happiness of seeing him restored, and once more composed, and happy
in Jesus.  But the time drew near that he must die: the Lord dealt very
graciously with him in that solemn period, for which we have much cause
to be thankful.

On the Lord’s-day morning of his death, he was visited by many godly
characters.  He looked around on them all, and thanked them for their
kind attention to him and his family.  When it was intimated they should
soon see each other in glory, he smiled, and said, _I shall be so taken
up with Jesus_, _I shall not be able to think much of any one else_.  He
now appeared to be dying upward, but spoke of it without dismay; being
wearied he desired to be once more turned in his bed.  He dosed a little
while; when well awoke, he exclaimed, _Christ is all in all_!  He paused;
then earnestly said _Blessed Jesus_, _hast thou not promised I shall be
with thee_? _and thou canst not be worse than thy word_.  He paused
again, then cried out, _He has done all things well_.  Then he said
again, _Thou dear Redeemer_, _dying Lamb_, _I love to hear of thee_.  At
three in the afternoon he seemed to be sinking in the arms of death, and
solemnly said to a friend, _I am getting nearer_.—Then he said soon
after, _I am very near_—_I am quite close_—(to his eternal home he
meant).  At about the close of the day after, having laid some time
quiet, he exclaimed, _Come Lord_, _come Lord Jesus_, _come quickly_!
_Come Lord_, _come_!—_He is come_, _he is come_!  _I come_, _I come_!
His voice gradually fell, but as long as his lips could move, his friends
could hear him say, _Come_, _come_, _come_!  With these words he dropt
asleep in the arms of our blessed Lord—to whom be glory.

                                                                   _AMEN_.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
